# Counter Project
## 📌 Project Overview
This is a simple *Counter App* built to understand the basics of the *DOM (Document Object Model)* in JavaScript.  
The goal of this project was to learn how to update values, handle events, and dynamically change content on a webpage.

## 📚 What I Learned
- What the *DOM* is and how it works  
- *Selecting elements* using getElementById() and querySelector()  
- *Updating HTML* using textContent  
- *Changing CSS* using element.style  
- *Event Listeners* to run functions on clicks  
- Basic logic for increasing and decreasing a number  

These helped me understand the *4 core pillars of DOM*:  
1. Selecting Elements  
2. Changing HTML  
3. Changing CSS  
4. Event Listeners

## 🔢 Counter App — Description
- A heading displays the current count (starting from 0)  
- Two buttons: *Increase* & *Decrease*  
- Clicking them updates the count in real time  
- UI updates using simple DOM manipulation in JavaScript  


## 💬 My Experience  
This project helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with the webpage through the DOM.  
It gave me confidence in using event listeners, updating UI, and basic logic building.  
This is an important step forward in my *Web Development Journey*.
